<p style="text-align:justify"> I am a genomics data scientist at the <a href="http://www.centenary.org.au/cen_program/gene-stem-cell-therapy/" target="_blank"> Gene and Stem Cell Therapy Program at the Centenary Institute</a> in Sydney, where I investigate how the mammalian genome works using next-generation sequencing. I use a combination of preexisting bioinformatics software and custom R, python, and shell scripts to process terabytes of data on a daily basis, taking advantage of the University of Sydney's HPC facilites. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> I recently undertook a Bioinformatics PhD at the <a href="http://www.imb.uq.edu.au" target="_blank">Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland</a>, under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Taft, Associate Professor Ernst Wolvetang, Dr. Cas Simons, Dr. Guy Barry and Professor John Mattick. My <a href="/research.html">work</a> focused on using high-throughput sequencing to understand changes in the transcriptome that occur during neuronal functioning in normal cells and in disease; and on induced pluripotent stem cells as models of the human nervous system. For many years, I have been passionate about <a href="teaching.html">teaching</a>, especially programming and bioinformatics to biologists, and was able to do a signifcant amount of this during my PhD studies. I also hold a <a href="/cv.html">Specialist Degree in Biochemistry with a Major in Molecular Biology</a> from Lomonosov Moscow State University.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I <a href="/blog">blog</a> on my adventures in data analysis and maintain a personal <a href="/wiki">wiki</a> to collect relevant code, techniques and recommendations from the web and genomics software mailing lists. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dvanichkina">twitter</a>.</p>
