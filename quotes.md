### On cell culture practices: from Laurent 2011
In routine practice, the culture of any given line is highly branched, and investigators frequently do not know the true relationship among the various cryopreserved stocks, frozen nucleic acid samples, and live cultures for any given line. Our observa- tions indicate that it is critical not only to record the passage number, but also the ‘‘pedigree,’’ of each culture, in order to be able to know with certainty whether a previous assessment of the genomic stability of a line has any bearing on a current culture of that line.

### You need to assess genomic integrity even after differentiation: Laurent 2011
We suggest that it is important to assess the genomic normality of cells frequently, not only in the pluripotent state but also at the endpoint of differentiation experiments or other treatments.
